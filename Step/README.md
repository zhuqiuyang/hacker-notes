The explicit-control evaluator of 5.4 is a register machine whose controller interprets Scheme programs.

Two way gap High-level lang and register-machine language:
- interpreter: The explicit-control evaluator illustrates the strategy of interpretation.
- compiler: A compiler for a given source language and machine translates a source program into an equivalent program (called the object program) written in the machineâ€™s native language. 

Lisp interpreters are generally organized so that interpreted procedures and compiled procedures can call each other.
