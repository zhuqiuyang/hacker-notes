Perl isn't strictly a compiled language or an interpreted one.
> after perl has finished compiling the source into bytecode, it then takes on the role of interpreter, translating the virtual machine code into real code.

#### libraries, modules, packages
- **module** is a file or a bunch of files.
- **package** is purely part of the source code.
> A single file, for instance, can contain several packages. 
>
> a package can be spread over several files.
>
> A module typically lives in its own package, to keep it distinct from the code that you write and to keep it from interfering.
