## Preface

### How to use

aphoristic (格言)

Most books about programming give too many low-level details and examples, but fail at giving the reader a high-level feel for what is really going on. In this book, we prefer to err in the opposite direction.

### Chapter 1. Philosophy

#### Culture? What Culture?

software 快速发展, that technical cultures have been weak and ephemeral.

A very few software technologies have proved `durable` enough to evolve strong technical cultures, distinctive arts, and an associated design philosophy transmitted `across generations` of engineers.

The Unix culture is one of these. The Internet culture is another

#### The Durability of Unix

Unix also introduced both the now-ubiquitous tree-shaped file namespace with directory nodes and the pipeline for connecting programs.

覆盖大型机, PC, 嵌入式; 稳定.

#### The Case against Learning Unix Culture (反对 Unix 文化的例子)

Linux 和 BSD 等的崛起, 是打消对 UNIX 质疑的有力武器,
Chap 20 会介绍 UNIX 社区正努力解决 Unix 自身问题, 并重新掌握市场.

#### What Unix Gets Wrong

> “it is better to solve the right problem the wrong way than the wrong problem the right way”.
>
> -- Doug McIlroy

`mechanism, not policy`: look-and-feel (the policy)有终端用户自己 set.

* 这一缺点反而让 unix 更有生命力, 因为 policy 容易过时.

#### What Unix Gets Right

* Open-Source Software
* Cross-Platform Portability and Open Standards
* The Internet and the World Wide Web
* The Open-Source Community
* Flexibility All the Way Down
* Unix Is Fun to Hack
* The Lessons of Unix Can Be Applied Elsewhere
