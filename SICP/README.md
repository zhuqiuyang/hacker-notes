## Structure & Interpretation of Computer Programs

### 1A: Overview and Introduction to Lisp

> Don't confused of the essence of things what you are doing with the tools that you use.
>
> CS is about how-to knowledge. Formalize intuitions of process.

### 1B: Procedures and Processes; Substitution Model

- Subtitution Rule
- Iteration and Recursion
- Space & Time Complexity
- Fibnacci (Recursion)
- Hanoi (Recursion)
  - Q: How to implement using Iteration
- Else
  - `And the reason why people think of programming as being hard, of course, is because you're writing down a general rule, which is going to be used for lots of instances`

### 2A: Higher-order Procedures

- 抽离出 sum procedure. sigma .累加
- 求SQRT. 以(Heron of Alexandria)为例。讲解了 average damp is a high-order procedure。(用lambda 定义anonymous procedure.)
- 以Newton Metho 为例。进一步解释HOP。谈到了Wishful thinking，First-class citizens。
