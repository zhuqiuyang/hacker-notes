## 9A: Register Machines

Gerald Jay Sussman

### Part 1:

And so what we'd like to do now is diverge from the plan of telling you how to organize bigprograms, and rather tell you something about the mechanisms by which these things can be made to work.



To illustrate the design of a simple register machine, let us examine Euclidâ€™s Algorithm, which is used to compute the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers.

```lisp
(define (gcd a b)
  (if (= b 0)
      a
      (gcd b (remainder a b))))
```



One of the important things for designing a computer, which I think most designers don't do, is you study the problem you want to solve and then use what you learn from studying the problem you want to solve to put in the mechanisms needed to solve it in the computer you're building, nomore no less.
