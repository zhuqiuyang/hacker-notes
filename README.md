### 1. [How to Become A Hacker](http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/hacker-howto.html) - Eric Steven Raymond

> Not simply by accumulating languages — you need to learn how to think about programming problems in a general way, independent of any one language.
>
> To be a real hacker, you need to get to the point where you can learn a new language in days by relating what's in the manual to what you already know.
>
> What will do it is (a) *reading code* and (b) *writing code*.
>
> Hackers prefer *real* names. 

### 2. [How To Learn Hacking](http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/hacking-howto.html) - Perter Norvig
#### 2.1 Stages of Learning How To Hack
- [The Unix and Internet Fundamentals HOWTO](http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/Unix-and-Internet-Fundamentals-HOWTO/index.html)
#### Hacking have some characteristics that tend to set it apart from other styles of programming.

- Hacking is done on open source...

- Hacking is lightweight and exploratory...

- Hacking places a high value on modularity and reuse...

- Hacking favors **scrap-and-rebuild** over patch-and-extend. An essential part of hacking is ruthlessly **throwing away** code that has become overcomplicated or crufty, no matter how much time you have invested in it.

### 3. [Teach Yourself Programming in Ten Years](http://norvig.com/21-days.html)- Eric

Here's my recipe for programming success:

- Get **interested** in programming, ten years/10000 hours
- Program. Learn by doing

> the most effective learning requires a well-defined task with an **appropriate difficulty** level

- Learn at least a half dozen **programming languages:**
  - one that emphasizes class abstractions (like Java or C++),
  - one that emphasizes functional abstraction (like Lisp or ML or Haskell),
  - one that supports syntactic abstraction (like Lisp),
  - one that supports declarative specifications (like Prolog or C++ templates)
  - one that emphasizes parallelism (like Clojure or Go).
