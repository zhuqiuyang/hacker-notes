## Practial Common Lisp

### 1. Introduction: Why Lisp?
- Perl motto: "There's more than one way to do it."1
> Perl is also worth learning as "the duct tape of the Internet."

- Python: "There's only one way to do it."
- The nearest thing Common Lisp has to a motto is: "the programmable programming language."
> Common Lisp follows the philosophy that what's good for the language's designer is good for the language's users.
> clisp provide a much clearer mapping between your ideas about how the program works and the code you actually write. 
> Lisp, in addition to incorporating small changes that make particular programs easier to write
